Dataset Name: Predictive Maintenance for Data Centers

Domain: Technology (Data Center Operations & IT Infrastructure)
Industry: Technology, Cloud Computing, Data Centers
Use Case: Predictive Maintenance for Servers
Purpose: Reduce downtime and maintenance costs by predicting server failures based on hardware and software telemetry data.

Dataset Overview:
- Number of Records: 500
- Number of Features: 20
- Target Variable: failure_event (Binary: 1 = Failure, 0 = No Failure)
- Data Type: Synthetic (Statistically generated but realistic)

Business Problem & Solution:
Problem Statement:
Data centers house thousands of servers, and unexpected hardware failures lead to downtime, performance degradation, and revenue loss. Manual maintenance is inefficient, and a predictive AI model can proactively detect failures before they occur.

Solution:
This dataset enables the training of machine learning models that analyze hardware metrics (CPU usage, temperature, disk usage, error logs) to predict failures and recommend preventive actions.

Dataset Schema (Column Details):
server_id - Unique identifier for each server
location - Geographic location of the data center (US-East, EU-West, etc.)
timestamp - Time when the data was recorded
cpu_usage - CPU utilization in percentage (0-100%)
memory_usage - RAM usage in percentage (0-100%)
disk_usage - Storage utilization in percentage
network_latency - Average network latency in milliseconds
power_consumption - Energy consumed in kWh
temperature - Internal server temperature (Â°C)
fan_speed - Cooling fan speed (RPM)
error_logs_count - Number of system errors logged
last_maintenance - Date of the last maintenance check
operating_system - OS installed (Linux, Windows, etc.)
uptime_days - Number of days since last reboot
server_load - Workload intensity (0-100%)
redundancy_level - Level of redundancy (High, Medium, Low)
predictive_risk - Probability of failure (0-1)
server_age - Age of the server in years
failure_event - 1 if server failed, 0 if operational
maintenance_action - Recommended action (e.g., "Replace Fan", "Upgrade RAM")

Data Generation Methodology:
This dataset was synthetically generated using statistical distributions to closely mimic real-world data.
- CPU, memory, and temperature: Modeled using a normal distribution (bell curve) centered around realistic values.
- Error logs: Follow a Poisson distribution, meaning more errors occur when CPU usage is high.
- Failure events: Determined based on predictive risk, which considers multiple factors (e.g., CPU usage, age, temperature).
- Redundancy & maintenance actions: Assigned based on server health conditions.

Machine Learning Applications:
1. Predictive Maintenance (Classification Model)
   - Model Type: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
   - Target Variable: failure_event (0 or 1)
   - Goal: Predict if a server will fail soon based on its hardware metrics.

2. Failure Risk Estimation (Regression Model)
   - Model Type: Linear Regression, Neural Networks
   - Target Variable: predictive_risk (0-1)
   - Goal: Estimate the probability of failure based on past telemetry data.

3. Anomaly Detection (Unsupervised Model)
   - Model Type: Isolation Forest, Autoencoders
   - Goal: Detect unusual patterns in CPU usage, network latency, and temperature that indicate early warning signs of failure.

Ethical & Practical Considerations:
- Synthetic Data: This dataset is artificial but designed to follow real-world statistical properties.
- Bias Handling: No sensitive PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is included.
- Privacy Compliance: No real-world server details are exposed, making it safe for AI experimentation.

Dataset File & Access:
- File Format: CSV (synthetic_server_data.csv)
- Size: ~500 rows, 20 columns (~50 KB)
- Storage Location: Can be stored in AWS S3, Google Drive, or local storage

Next Steps:
- Train a machine learning model using failure_event as the target.
- Perform feature selection to find the most important predictors of failure.
- Deploy a real-time monitoring system to predict failures in live server environments.

Conclusion:
This dataset provides a comprehensive view of server health monitoring and predictive maintenance. It is ideal for AI research, ML model development, and IT operations optimization.
